# Locally

So instead of usual `pip` I used [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
as it is just nicer and faster to work with and you can just use `uv run python3 main.py`.

If instead you preffer pip make sure you have following packages installed:
- matplotlib>=3.10.6
- numpy>=2.3.3
- pyqt6>=6.9.1
